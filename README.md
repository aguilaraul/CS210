This course introduces students to team-based software development and engineering methods, including specification, design, implementation, testing, and process. It emphasizes team development, agile methods, software design, and use of software engineering tools, such as integrated development environments, version control, automated test framework, build automation, and software containers. As a culminating project, each team produces three deliverables: a Software Requirements Specification document, a Software Design Specification document, and an executable application satisfying stakeholder requirements.
